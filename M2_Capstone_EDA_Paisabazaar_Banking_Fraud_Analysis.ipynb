        "- **Financial Behavior**: Most customers show responsible financial habits like balanced debt, regular payments, and steady credit card usage — though some outliers exist.\n",

        "- **Key Influencers**: Factors like age, annual income, credit utilization ratio, and delayed payments play a major role in determining credit scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Interest Rates**: There is considerable variation in interest rates across customers, suggesting that lending terms may not always align with creditworthiness.\n",
